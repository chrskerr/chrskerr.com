			I am a software developer with over 10 years experience in IT, technology, business, commerce and sales / relationship management.
		</p>
		<p>
			After leaving school, I moved into a business and relationships career. Over the years I was progressively drawn into the IT industry because of my interest in it, and took on technical sales roles. However, I continued to want to become more technical and push that skillset beyond what I could in sales.
		</p>
		<p>
			So I switched careers to development in mid-2019, recently completing a software engineering programme with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/sydney">General Assembly</a>. This focussed primarily on JavaScript, Ruby, React, Rails, & Node. With a secondary focus on jQuery, Vue, GraphQL, plus exposure to much more.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am currently working in a temporary assignment as a Junior Developer, working on React & Node. I work across the entire stack from databases to frontend.
		</p>
		<p>
			I am now looking for a permanent role that I can commit to long term.
