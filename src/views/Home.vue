    <p>Welcome to my homepage / portfolio.</p>
    <p>
      This is a collection of projects and interests that I've worked on so
      far, plus an excuse to learn much more about my Raspberry Pi (where this
      hosted) and Vue (the current server).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm currently enrolled in General Assembly's Software Immersive programme,
      learning full-stack web development with a hope to code for a living once
      I graduate.
