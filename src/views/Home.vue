      I like solving problems, technology and talking to people.
    </p>
    <p>
      So this year I decided to resign from my technical sales role to learn how to code and begin a career as a developer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently searching for my first software development role to begin utilising the skills that I have learnt after graduating from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive programme <a target="_blank" href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/sydney">(more details)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>I have focussed on the following technologies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>React</li>
      <li>Vue</li>
      <li>HTML / CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
      <li>Node & ExpressJS</li>
      <li>SQL, Postgresql, Mongo</li>
      <li>Ruby & Ruby on Rails</li>
      <li>Elixir (currently learning the basics)</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
